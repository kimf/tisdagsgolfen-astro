## Game formats - Finally?

## Lag men individuell score (typ b√§stboll)

The Best Ball format, also known as Four Ball, is a popular choice in both friendly matches and competitive tournaments, involving teams of two players each. Throughout the game, each player plays their own ball from tee to green on every hole, independently managing their own game. The team's score for each hole is determined by the lower of the two scores recorded by the team members.
In regular Best Ball, for example, if Player A scores a 4 and Player B scores a 5, the team‚Äôs score is 4.

## Lag men individuell score - po√§ng (typ b√§stboll etc)
